# üîê Authentication

## Authentication Domain

### Overview

The authentication domain within the FoodService application encompasses the functionalities related to user authentication, authorization, and user management. This domain ensures secure access to the application's resources by verifying the identity of users and managing their roles and permissions.

### Components

#### AuthController

The `AuthController` is responsible for handling incoming requests related to user authentication and authorization. It includes endpoints for user registration (`SignUp`), user login (`SignIn`), adding users to administrative roles (`AddUserToAdminRole`), retrieving the current user (`GetCurrentUser`), listing users (`ListUsers`), and retrieving user details (`GetUserDto`). This controller enforces authorization rules using ASP.NET Core's authorization attributes, restricting access to certain endpoints based on user roles.

#### AuthCommand

The `AuthCommand` class implements the business logic for authentication operations defined in the `IAuthCommand` interface. It delegates the execution of these operations to the `IAuthService`. The class handles user sign-up, sign-in, adding users to admin roles, retrieving the current user, listing users, and retrieving user DTOs. It encapsulates the responses using `ResponseCommon` objects to indicate the success or failure of operations.

#### AuthService

The `AuthService` class provides implementations for authentication-related operations defined in the `IAuthService` interface. It interacts with repositories, ASP.NET Identity's user manager, configuration settings, and HTTP context accessor to perform operations such as listing users, retrieving user details, updating and deleting users, user sign-up, adding users to admin roles, user sign-in, and retrieving the current user. This class utilizes ASP.NET Identity for user management and JWT authentication for generating authentication tokens.
